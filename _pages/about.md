*Computation Modeling for the Flourishing of the whole Creation*

---

Olá! My name is Eric Araújo, and currently, I hold the following positions:

* Associate Professor at the [Computer Science Department](https://dcc.ufla.br/) at [UFLA](https://ufla.br/) (Universidade Federal de Lavras, Brazil);
* Head of the Behavioural Informatics Laboratory (BILbo);



Research Work
======
My main work is with **cognitive modelling of social contagion** phenomena. In other words, I explore the ways people influence each other about their opinions, behaviour and perceptions using **agent-based and temporal-causal models**.

My contributions are mainly in cognitive computing, modelling and simulation areas. Therefore, the work I develop is multidisciplinary, using computer science tools to solve problems in areas such as public security, the spread of fake news, promoting healthier lifestyles, etc.

My PhD Thesis [Contagious: Modeling the spread of behaviours, perceptions and emotions in social networks](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12fdR1cLRy0w3ZdYKSot8UX0hrbqrOA7k/view?usp=sharing) is available for download.
