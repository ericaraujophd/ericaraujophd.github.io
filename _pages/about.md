*Computational Modeling for the Flourishing of the Whole Creation*

---

Olá! My name is Eric Araújo, and currently, I hold the following positions:

* Professor at the [Computer Science Department](https://calvin.edu/academics/school-stem/computer-science) at [Calvin University](https://calvin.edu/);
* Head of the Behavioural Informatics Laboratory (BILbo);



## Research Work

My main research work is with **cognitive modelling of social contagion** phenomena. In other words, I explore the ways people influence each other about their opinions, behaviour and perceptions using **agent-based and temporal-causal models**.

I have contributions in the areas of cognitive computing, modelling and simulation. Therefore, the work I develop is multidisciplinary, using computer science tools to solve problems in areas such as public security, the spread of fake news, promoting healthier lifestyles, etc.

You can download my PhD Thesis on the following linl -- [Contagious: Modeling the spread of behaviours, perceptions and emotions in social networks](../files/Contagious_Eric_Araujo.pdf).
