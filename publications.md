    <p>Here you will find my publications by year. Some of them are scientific papers, some of them are interviews or newspaper's articles. I count all of it as part of my research work, and valuable as resource for those who are interested in my developments.</p>
    <p>This page is permanently under construction, so if you want to have my whole body of publications in one place, I recommend going to my <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QlE8JOoAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1">Google Scholar profile</a>.</p>
    <p>You can also find my CV in Portuguese at <a href="http://lattes.cnpq.br/8108200264338612">Lattes CV</a>. Also, my social networks in English are <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Eric_Fernandes_De_Mello_Araujo">ResearchGate</a> and <a href="https://www.threads.net/@eric.araujo.phd?hl=en">Threads</a>.</p>
    <p>My CV in English is available <a href="cv/Eric_Araujo_CV.pdf">in this link</a> and my <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4263-9075">ORCID</a>.</p>
    <p>I have also created a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/EricAra%C3%BAjo">YouTube channel</a> during the 2020 pandemic to divulge my work as well as teaching resources on Agent-based modeling with Netlogo.</p>
    <p>Please let me know if any links are not working, or if you need some of my papers and can't access them by <a href="mailto:eric.araujo@calvin.edu">emailing me</a>.</p>
