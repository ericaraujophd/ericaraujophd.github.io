## Student Mentorship & Academic Guidance

As an educator and researcher at Calvin University, I am passionate about mentoring students at various stages of their academic journey. My advising philosophy is grounded in the Reformed tradition, emphasizing the integration of values and learning while fostering independent thinking, research excellence, and personal growth. I support students in achieving their academic and professional goals through work that honors God and serves the common good.

:::{note} Values & Learning Integration
My advising approach is rooted in a Christian worldview, which sees all of creation as God's domain and all legitimate human activity as having potential for glorifying God. I believe in a collaborative mentoring approach that combines structured guidance with intellectual freedom, encouraging students to explore how their computational work can serve meaningful purposes and contribute to human flourishing. My goal is to help students develop critical thinking skills, research methodologies, and the confidence to tackle complex problems while maintaining a thoughtful perspective on technology's role in society.

## Research Areas & Opportunities

My students work on cutting-edge projects that combine technical excellence with thoughtful stewardship and service:

:::{tip} Values-Integrated Research Themes

- **Agent-Based Modeling**: Simulation of complex social and biological systems with attention to human dignity and flourishing
- **Social Computing**: Exploring technology's role in community building and social justice  
- **Complex Networks**: Analysis of urban topology, social networks, and epidemiological models to serve vulnerable populations
- **Machine Learning Applications**: Ethical data analysis and prediction models that respect human agency and responsibility
- **Cognitive Modeling**: Understanding human behavior through computational approaches while honoring human dignity
- **Technology Integration**: Exploring how digital tools can support community formation and meaningful connection

## Student Levels & Programs

I mentor students across different academic levels:

- **ðŸŽ“ B.S. Students**: Senior projects, independent studies, and research experiences that integrate values and learning
- **ðŸŽ“ M.S. Students**: Master's thesis supervision with emphasis on ethical technology and thoughtful stewardship
- **ðŸŽ“ Ph.D. Students**: Doctoral dissertation guidance exploring technology's role in meaningful service

:::{important} For Prospective Advisees - Values & Learning Integration
If you're interested in working with me, please review my current and past student projects to understand how we integrate thoughtful perspectives with rigorous computational research. I particularly welcome students who are passionate about:

- Exploring how technology can serve meaningful purposes and promote human flourishing
- Investigating ethical dimensions of artificial intelligence and data science
- Understanding the intersection of values, technology, and social justice
- Developing computational approaches that honor human dignity and responsibility

## Perspective on Technology & Research

:::{note} Thoughtful Stewardship in Computing
As scholars in a values-oriented tradition, we approach technology not as neutral tools but as part of our calling to be faithful stewards of knowledge and resources. Our research considers:

- **Human Dignity**: How computational models respect the inherent worth of humanity
- **Justice & Flourishing**: Using technology to address systemic inequalities and promote the common good
- **Ethical AI**: Developing algorithms that reflect values of fairness, transparency, and accountability
- **Community Building**: Leveraging social computing to strengthen relationships and build authentic community
- **Responsible Innovation**: Applying computational methods to address societal challenges sustainably

## Collaboration & Partnerships

Many of my advising relationships extend beyond individual supervision to include:

- International research collaborations with Christian institutions (Brazil, Netherlands, USA)
- Partnerships with faith-based organizations addressing social challenges
- Conference presentations at both technical and Christian academic venues
- Cross-institutional projects that bridge secular and religious perspectives
- Church and community engagement through applied research

:::{seealso} Kingdom Impact Through Student Success
My former students have gone on to pursue advanced degrees, work in technology companies, and contribute to academic research while maintaining their Christian witness. Several have:

- Co-authored publications that demonstrate faith-learning integration
- Presented research at Christian academic conferences and technical venues
- Secured positions where they can influence technology development from a Christian perspective
- Continued their calling to serve others through ethical technology development
