    "text": "Abstract Submitted to Baylor University\nIn an age marked by increasing political polarization, churches have become both sanctuaries of spiritual life and sites of cultural tension. This project investigates how political polarization shapes—and is shaped by—relationships, discourse, and spiritual identity within Christian communities. By building computational models of opinion dynamics and social influence, the project offers a novel way to understand the subtle, often invisible processes through which division emerges and spreads in church networks.\nUsing Agent-Based Modeling (ABM), we simulate how individuals in a congregation respond to political and theological stimuli, interact with peers, and adjust their beliefs over time. These agents are not abstract automatons, but are grounded in a rich psychological and theological anthropology. Drawing on the writings of Herman Bavinck, the model incorporates notions of personality, conscience, volition, and community—all essential to understanding human behavior in a covenantal context.\nEmpirical data from Pew Research Center and related sources inform the model’s assumptions, enabling simulations that reflect real-world diversity in denominational background, media exposure, and social cohesion. We examine how events such as sermons, elections, or controversies catalyze polarization within congregational networks. Special attention is paid to mechanisms like cognitive dissonance, moral justification, and echo chambers, which distort the pursuit of truth and reconciliation.\nTheologically, the project invites reflection on the church’s calling to be a body marked by unity in Christ amid cultural fragmentation. Culturally, it asks how digital media, political ideology, and identity politics intersect with the ecclesial imagination. By visualizing how fragmentation takes root and spreads, the models help us see what’s at stake—and where hope remains.\nThis research is deeply interdisciplinary, sitting at the crossroads of computer science, theology, psychology, and cultural studies. It offers a diagnostic tool for scholars, pastors, and lay leaders concerned with the health of Christian witness in divided times. More than just explanation, the goal is to open space for imagination: how might church communities foster resilience, bridge divides, and embody alternative forms of belonging?\nUltimately, this project contributes to a larger conversation about the moral and spiritual shape of our common life. By uniting empirical insight with theological depth, it seeks to model not only how polarization happens—but how the church might respond faithfully."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This is a multidisciplinary work that involves a handful areas for study and a great deal of application. I will start by explaining what are agent-based models through some of my previous works. I will also talk about the methods for building behavioral models and the challenges when creating them. I will present then a draft for what is required to develop a model that account for the problem of Christian communities.\n\n\nWe live in a time of increasing political polarization, where individuals and groups are often divided along ideological lines. This polarization can have significant implications for social cohesion, democratic processes, and the functioning of communities. In this context, understanding the dynamics of political polarization is crucial for fostering dialogue and promoting social harmony.\nThe de-churching phenomenon, characterized by the decline in church attendance and participation, has been a notable trend in recent years. This trend is particularly pronounced among younger generations, who are increasingly distancing themselves from traditional religious institutions. The reasons for this shift are complex and multifaceted, encompassing cultural, social, and personal factors.\nIn his recent book, The Great De-Churching, Jim Davis and Michael Graham explore the factors contributing to this phenomenon and its implications for society. They argue that the decline in church attendance is not merely a statistical trend but a reflection of deeper societal changes, including shifts in values, beliefs, and community engagement.\nBryan Chapell, in his book The Multigenerational Church Crisis: Why We Don’t Understand Each Other and How to Unite in Mission (2024), delves into the challenges faced by churches in bridging generational divides. He emphasizes the importance of understanding the perspectives and experiences of different age groups to foster unity and collaboration within congregations. He also points out that the de-churching process is not exclusive to younger generations, but also affects older generations, leading to a complex interplay of beliefs and practices within the church community.\nThe table below summarizes the key differences between the two generations, highlighting the contrasting values and priorities that contribute to the polarization within church communities:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAspect\nOlder Generation (Fifties and Older)\nYounger Generation (Forties and Younger)\n\n\n\n\nPerception\n“We are (were) a majority”\n“We are a minority”\n\n\nMission\nTake control of culture\nMake credible our faith\n\n\nMeans\nBring a halt to:(1) abortion(2) homosexual agenda(3) pornography(4) illegal drugs(5) gambling(6) green movement(7) illegal immigration(8) racial discrimination\nHelp with:(1) adoption and foster care(2) care for and witness to LGBTQ+ persons(3) liberating victims of sex trafficking and sex addiction(4) substance addiction counseling and rescue(5) gaming and gambling addictions(6) creation care(7) refugee compassion and care(8) racial reconciliation and justice\n\n\n\nEven though recent research has shown that the church decline stabilized in the last years, it also shows a division and a preference for different types of churches based on demographic factors such as age, gender, and political affiliation. This division is particularly pronounced among younger generations, who are more likely to seek out churches that align with their values and beliefs.\n\n\n\nIn his paper titled “Political Polarization and the Churches: Tocqueville on religion, democracy and future of Christianity”, Charles McDaniel Jr. presents a very interesting picture of the church according to the predictions of Alexis de Tocqueville. He argues that the church is a crucial institution for maintaining social cohesion and preventing political polarization. However, he also acknowledges that the church is not immune to the forces of polarization and that it can contribute to the fragmentation of society.\nIn this work they point out to one of Tocqueville’s sources, Father Mullon who worked as a missionary among Native American tribes in Michigan, saying he\n\nposited an inverse relationship between religion’s influence in society and its involvement in politics, stating that the “less religion and its ministers are mixed up with government, the less they are involved in political debate, the more influential religious ideas will become”.\n\nDan White Jr. in his book Love Over Fear: Facing Monsters, Befriending Enemies, and Healing Our Polarized World (2020) argues that polarization is a pervasive issue in contemporary society, affecting not only political discourse but also personal relationships and community dynamics. He emphasizes the need for empathy, understanding, and love as antidotes to polarization, suggesting that these values can help bridge divides and foster reconciliation.\nHe defines polarization this way:\n\nPolarization takes people that have something in common, emphasizes their differences, hardens their differences into disgust, and turns their disgust into blatant hatred. It creates two sharply contrasting groups and pits them against each other, shaping us for only two options—“our side” or “their side.” It’s a suffocating social arrangement. Polarization is a power and principality.\n\nIn his many examples of how he experienced polarization in his own life, he points out to a moment when two families left his church because of a feeling of threat due to the presence of others with a different political view. He says:\n\nI grieved that both of these folks could not stay in the mix together. They were repelled by each other. Rather than moving toward one another, despite their differences, they chose more distance.\n\nThere is a common understanding on matters such as people’s opinions, beliefs, and behaviors that they are not static, but rather dynamic and subject to change over time. This is particularly true in the context of political polarization, where individuals’ views can shift in response to various factors, such as social influences, media exposure, and personal experiences.\nBut there is also an understanding that changes don’t come easily, and that people are often resistant to changing their opinions, especially when they are strongly held. This resistance can be driven by a variety of factors, including cognitive biases, social pressures, and emotional attachments to one’s beliefs.\nIn the context of Christian communities, this resistance to change can be particularly pronounced, as individuals may feel a strong sense of identity and belonging tied to their religious beliefs. This can make it difficult for them to engage with differing perspectives or to consider alternative viewpoints.\nFortunately, or unfortunately, we are people of the Bible. We take Jesus’ words seriously, even when they seem too naive or impractical.\n\nYou have heard that it was said, ‘Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who hurt you, that you may be children of your Father in heaven… if you love those who love you, what reward will you get? . . . And if you are hospitable to only your own people, what are you doing more than others?” (Matt. 5:1, 43–48, Msg).\n\nJesus’ teachings on love and forgiveness challenge us to transcend our differences and embrace a more inclusive and compassionate approach to relationships. He calls us to love not only our friends and neighbors but also our enemies, urging us to pray for those who hurt us and to extend hospitality beyond our own circles.\nBut how does that lead us to models of Christian communities? How can we model the dynamics of political polarization in Christian communities, taking into account the teachings of Jesus and the complexities of human behavior?\n\n\n\n\n\nOur simulation requires a complex systems approach, taking into account the interactions between various agents and their environments. This involves modeling not only individual behaviors but also the emergent properties that arise from these interactions.\nWe consider that people’s opinions, beliefs, and behaviors are not static, but rather dynamic and subject to change over time. This is particularly true in the context of political polarization, where individuals’ views can shift in response to various factors, such as social influences, media exposure, and personal experiences.\nOur model incorporates the dynamics based on social influences, media exposure and considers cognitive biases that can affect how individuals perceive and respond to differing viewpoints. This allows us to capture the complexities of political polarization in Christian communities, where individuals may feel a strong sense of identity and belonging tied to their religious beliefs.\nOver time, our agents will interact with one another and with their environment, leading to emergent patterns of polarization and fragmentation. The model will include individual agents representing members of the community, each with their own beliefs and preferences. The agents will interact with one another and with their environment, leading to emergent patterns of polarization and fragmentation.\n\n\n\nAgent-based modeling (ABM) is a powerful computational approach that allows researchers to simulate the interactions of individual agents within a system. This method is particularly useful for studying complex social phenomena, such as political polarization, as it enables the exploration of how individual behaviors and interactions can lead to emergent patterns at the group level.\nIn other words, ABMs are computational models that simulate behavior of individual agents. ABMs are useful for studying emergent phenomena, where the behavior of the whole system is not simply the sum of the behaviors of its parts. They are particularly useful for studying complex systems, such as social networks, where individual behaviors can lead to unexpected outcomes.\nOne of the main benefits of ABMs is their ability to capture the heterogeneity of individual agents and their interactions. This allows researchers to explore how different behaviors and interactions can lead to different outcomes, such as the emergence of political polarization.\nThis method was originally developed in the 1970s and 1980s with models for social segregation, such as Schelling’s model of residential segregation. Since then, ABMs have been applied to a wide range of fields, including economics, ecology, and sociology.\nABMs receive different names in different fields, such as multi-agent systems, agent-based simulations, and agent-based computational economics. However, they all share the same basic principles of simulating the interactions of individual agents within a system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding behavioral models involves several key steps, including defining the agents, their behaviors, and the environment in which they interact. The process typically begins with identifying the key components of the system being studied and determining how these components interact with one another.\nOnce the agents and their behaviors have been defined, the next step is to implement the model using a programming language or simulation platform. This involves coding the rules that govern the agents’ interactions and specifying how the model will be run.\nThe model can then be tested and validated by running simulations and comparing the results to empirical data or theoretical predictions. This process often involves iterating on the model design to refine the agents’ behaviors and improve the accuracy of the simulations.\n\n\n\nCreating behavioral models presents several challenges, including the complexity of accurately representing individual behaviors and interactions. One of the main difficulties is capturing the diversity of behaviors and preferences among agents, which can lead to emergent patterns that are not easily predictable.\nAnother challenge is ensuring that the model is computationally efficient, as complex models can require significant computational resources to run. This can limit the scale and scope of the simulations, making it difficult to explore certain aspects of the system being studied.\nAdditionally, validating the model against empirical data can be challenging, as it requires access to high-quality data and a clear understanding of the underlying processes being modeled. This can be particularly difficult in social systems, where data may be sparse or difficult to obtain.\nFinally, interpreting the results of the simulations can be complex, as emergent patterns may not have straightforward explanations. Researchers must carefully analyze the results and consider the implications for understanding the system being studied.\n\n\n\n\nIn his paper titled “Political Polarization and the Churches: Tocqueville on religion, democracy and future of Christianity”, Charles McDaniel Jr. presents a very interesting picture of the church according to the predictions of Alexis de Tocqueville.

These models have shown that individual behaviors and interactions can lead to emergent patterns at the group level, such as the emergence of polarization and the spread of misinformation.\nDrawing from Schelling’s model of residential segregation, we can build a model that captures the dynamics of political polarization in Christian communities.

Each simulation tick represents one Sunday service, allowing us to observe how polarization develops over weeks and months.\nThe model is built on the principle that political differences create tension in social interactions, which affects people’s emotional well-being and their desire to continue participating in the community. We implement this model using NetLogo 6.4.0, a powerful platform specifically designed for agent-based modeling.\n\nposited an inverse relationship between religion’s influence in society and its involvement in politics, stating that the “less religion and its ministers are mixed up with government, the less they are involved in political debate, the more influential religious ideas will become”.\n\nDan White Jr. in his book Love Over Fear: Facing Monsters, Befriending Enemies, and Healing Our Polarized World (2020) argues that polarization is a pervasive issue in contemporary society, affecting not only political discourse but also personal relationships and community dynamics.

The agents will interact with one another and with their environment, leading to emergent patterns of polarization and fragmentation.\nThis first attempt is a simple model that captures the dynamics of political polarization in Christian communities. The model includes individual agents representing members of the community, each with their own beliefs and preferences. The agents will interact with one another and with their environment, leading to emergent patterns of polarization and fragmentation.\n\n\n\nEach church member in our model has four key attributes that drive their behavior:\n\nPolitical Leaning: This ranges from -1 to +1, where negative values represent progressive views and positive values represent conservative views. We use a normal distribution with tanh transformation to ensure realistic political distributions while keeping values bounded.\nThreshold Tolerance: This represents how much political difference an individual can tolerate in their interactions, ranging from 0 to 1. Higher values mean greater tolerance for political diversity.\nActivity Level: This determines the probability that someone will attend church services, ranging from 0 to 1. This starts high but can decrease based on negative experiences.\nEmotional State: This captures their current well-being level, also ranging from -1 to +1. This is the key outcome variable that determines whether someone stays or leaves.\n\nThe church environment is modeled as a realistic 400-seat sanctuary with 25 rows of pews. Each row has 16 seats arranged as 8 seats, then a center aisle, then 8 more seats. This spatial arrangement matters because people tend to interact more with those sitting nearby.\nChurch members are connected through a social network that represents friendships and regular social interactions. These connections are initially formed based on spatial proximity, political homophily, and regular attendance patterns. Each connection has two properties: tie strength, which measures relationship intensity, and political similarity, which tracks how compatible the connected individuals are politically.\n\n\n\nEach Sunday follows a five-step simulation cycle. Members decide whether to attend based on their activity level and emotional state. Attending members interact with others, following realistic patterns where they prioritize existing strong connections, then nearby neighbors, then random others. The quality of each interaction depends on political similarity and mutual tolerance, with these interactions affecting emotional states through our core mathematical model.\nThe heart of our model is the equation for updating emotional states:\nEmotional State = Base + α × (Connection Score) - β × (Dissimilarity Penalty)\nThe base represents a person’s natural emotional baseline when attending church. Alpha (α) weights how much positive interactions with connected friends boost emotional state, while beta (β) weights how much negative interactions with politically different people hurt emotional state.\nThe social network evolves dynamically based on interactions. Connections can strengthen through positive shared experiences, new connections can form between people with high political similarity and positive interactions, and connections can weaken through poor interactions or missed attendance. This process typically leads to increasing political homophily over time.\n\n\n\nMembers can permanently leave the church based on three factors: low emotional state (when consistently negative experiences occur), extended non-attendance (after 8 weeks of not attending), and very low activity level (when motivation to participate drops below 0.3). When someone leaves, they sever all social connections and disappear from the community, representing permanent departure rather than temporary absence.\nThe model has several key parameters that can be adjusted to explore different scenarios. Alpha (α) controls how much positive social connections matter for emotional well-being, while beta (β) controls how much political differences hurt emotional well-being. Church size can be varied from 50 to 600 members to explore how community size affects polarization dynamics, and base emotional state sets the baseline mood level for church attendance.\n\n\n\nThe model tracks numerous metrics to assess polarization and community health, including attendance patterns, political metrics, emotional well-being, network statistics, and departure tracking. Agents are color-coded by political leaning (red for conservative, blue for progressive, purple for moderate), and social connections can be displayed to show network structure.\nThis model can be used to explore several important research questions about how different levels of political tolerance affect community stability, what role strong social connections play in preventing departures, and how community size affects polarization dynamics. The model also allows us to test interventions, such as increasing everyone’s tolerance or strengthening existing friendships.\n\n\n\nThis model addresses real challenges facing religious communities today, as many churches report increasing political tension among members, with some people leaving due to political disagreements. The model helps us understand the mechanisms behind these dynamics - how individual psychology, social networks, and political differences interact to create community-level outcomes. While simplified, the model captures key processes: homophily in relationship formation, the emotional impact of political disagreement, and the cumulative effect of negative experiences leading to departure.\nLike all models, this one has limitations. It simplifies complex human behavior and doesn’t capture many factors that influence church participation, such as theology, leadership, family connections, or external life events. Future extensions could include leadership effects, external events, belief change through social influence, and multiple communities.

    "text": "We live in a time of increasing political polarization, where individuals and groups are often divided along ideological lines. This polarization can have significant implications for social cohesion, democratic processes, and the functioning of communities. In this context, understanding the dynamics of political polarization is crucial for fostering dialogue and promoting social harmony.\nThe de-churching phenomenon, characterized by the decline in church attendance and participation, has been a notable trend in recent years. This trend is particularly pronounced among younger generations, who are increasingly distancing themselves from traditional religious institutions. The reasons for this shift are complex and multifaceted, encompassing cultural, social, and personal factors.\nIn his recent book, The Great De-Churching, Jim Davis and Michael Graham explore the factors contributing to this phenomenon and its implications for society. They argue that the decline in church attendance is not merely a statistical trend but a reflection of deeper societal changes, including shifts in values, beliefs, and community engagement.\nBryan Chapell, in his book The Multigenerational Church Crisis: Why We Don’t Understand Each Other and How to Unite in Mission (2024), delves into the challenges faced by churches in bridging generational divides. He emphasizes the importance of understanding the perspectives and experiences of different age groups to foster unity and collaboration within congregations. He also points out that the de-churching process is not exclusive to younger generations, but also affects older generations, leading to a complex interplay of beliefs and practices within the church community.\nThe table below summarizes the key differences between the two generations, highlighting the contrasting values and priorities that contribute to the polarization within church communities:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAspect\nOlder Generation (Fifties and Older)\nYounger Generation (Forties and Younger)\n\n\n\n\nPerception\n“We are (were) a majority”\n“We are a minority”\n\n\nMission\nTake control of culture\nMake credible our faith\n\n\nMeans\nBring a halt to:(1) abortion(2) homosexual agenda(3) pornography(4) illegal drugs(5) gambling(6) green movement(7) illegal immigration(8) racial discrimination\nHelp with:(1) adoption and foster care(2) care for and witness to LGBTQ+ persons(3) liberating victims of sex trafficking and sex addiction(4) substance addiction counseling and rescue(5) gaming and gambling addictions(6) creation care(7) refugee compassion and care(8) racial reconciliation and justice\n\n\n\nEven though recent research has shown that the church decline stabilized in the last years, it also shows a division and a preference for different types of churches based on demographic factors such as age, gender, and political affiliation. This division is particularly pronounced among younger generations, who are more likely to seek out churches that align with their values and beliefs."

He argues that the church is a crucial institution for maintaining social cohesion and preventing political polarization. However, he also acknowledges that the church is not immune to the forces of polarization and that it can contribute to the fragmentation of society.\nIn this work they point out to one of Tocqueville’s sources, Father Mullon who worked as a missionary among Native American tribes in Michigan, saying he\n\nposited an inverse relationship between religion’s influence in society and its involvement in politics, stating that the “less religion and its ministers are mixed up with government, the less they are involved in political debate, the more influential religious ideas will become”.\n\nDan White Jr. in his book Love Over Fear: Facing Monsters, Befriending Enemies, and Healing Our Polarized World (2020) argues that polarization is a pervasive issue in contemporary society, affecting not only political discourse but also personal relationships and community dynamics. He emphasizes the need for empathy, understanding, and love as antidotes to polarization, suggesting that these values can help bridge divides and foster reconciliation.\nHe defines polarization this way:\n\nPolarization takes people that have something in common, emphasizes their differences, hardens their differences into disgust, and turns their disgust into blatant hatred. It creates two sharply contrasting groups and pits them against each other, shaping us for only two options—“our side” or “their side.” It’s a suffocating social arrangement. Polarization is a power and principality.\n\nIn his many examples of how he experienced polarization in his own life, he points out to a moment when two families left his church because of a feeling of threat due to the presence of others with a different political view. He says:\n\nI grieved that both of these folks could not stay in the mix together. They were repelled by each other. Rather than moving toward one another, despite their differences, they chose more distance.\n\nThere is a common understanding on matters such as people’s opinions, beliefs, and behaviors that they are not static, but rather dynamic and subject to change over time. This is particularly true in the context of political polarization, where individuals’ views can shift in response to various factors, such as social influences, media exposure, and personal experiences.\nBut there is also an understanding that changes don’t come easily, and that people are often resistant to changing their opinions, especially when they are strongly held. This resistance can be driven by a variety of factors, including cognitive biases, social pressures, and emotional attachments to one’s beliefs.\nIn the context of Christian communities, this resistance to change can be particularly pronounced, as individuals may feel a strong sense of identity and belonging tied to their religious beliefs. This can make it difficult for them to engage with differing perspectives or to consider alternative viewpoints.\nFortunately, or unfortunately, we are people of the Bible. We take Jesus’ words seriously, even when they seem too naive or impractical.\n\nYou have heard that it was said, ‘Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who hurt you, that you may be children of your Father in heaven… if you love those who love you, what reward will you get? . . . And if you are hospitable to only your own people, what are you doing more than others?” (Matt. 5:1, 43–48, Msg).\n\nJesus’ teachings on love and forgiveness challenge us to transcend our differences and embrace a more inclusive and compassionate approach to relationships. He calls us to love not only our friends and neighbors but also our enemies, urging us to pray for those who hurt us and to extend hospitality beyond our own circles.\nBut how does that lead us to models of Christian communities? How can we model the dynamics of political polarization in Christian communities, taking into account the teachings of Jesus and the complexities of human behavior?"

    "text": "Our simulation requires a complex systems approach, taking into account the interactions between various agents and their environments. This involves modeling not only individual behaviors but also the emergent properties that arise from these interactions.\nWe consider that people’s opinions, beliefs, and behaviors are not static, but rather dynamic and subject to change over time. This is particularly true in the context of political polarization, where individuals’ views can shift in response to various factors, such as social influences, media exposure, and personal experiences.\nOur model incorporates the dynamics based on social influences, media exposure and considers cognitive biases that can affect how individuals perceive and respond to differing viewpoints. This allows us to capture the complexities of political polarization in Christian communities, where individuals may feel a strong sense of identity and belonging tied to their religious beliefs.\nOver time, our agents will interact with one another and with their environment, leading to emergent patterns of polarization and fragmentation. The model will include individual agents representing members of the community, each with their own beliefs and preferences. The agents will interact with one another and with their environment, leading to emergent patterns of polarization and fragmentation.\n\n\n\nAgent-based modeling (ABM) is a powerful computational approach that allows researchers to simulate the interactions of individual agents within a system. This method is particularly useful for studying complex social phenomena, such as political polarization, as it enables the exploration of how individual behaviors and interactions can lead to emergent patterns at the group level.\nIn other words, ABMs are computational models that simulate behavior of individual agents. ABMs are useful for studying emergent phenomena, where the behavior of the whole system is not simply the sum of the behaviors of its parts. They are particularly useful for studying complex systems, such as social networks, where individual behaviors can lead to unexpected outcomes.\nOne of the main benefits of ABMs is their ability to capture the heterogeneity of individual agents and their interactions. This allows researchers to explore how different behaviors and interactions can lead to different outcomes, such as the emergence of political polarization.\nThis method was originally developed in the 1970s and 1980s with models for social segregation, such as Schelling’s model of residential segregation. Since then, ABMs have been applied to a wide range of fields, including economics, ecology, and sociology.\nABMs receive different names in different fields, such as multi-agent systems, agent-based simulations, and agent-based computational economics. However, they all share the same basic principles of simulating the interactions of individual agents within a system."

    "text": "Building behavioral models involves several key steps, including defining the agents, their behaviors, and the environment in which they interact. The process typically begins with identifying the key components of the system being studied and determining how these components interact with one another.\nOnce the agents and their behaviors have been defined, the next step is to implement the model using a programming language or simulation platform. This involves coding the rules that govern the agents’ interactions and specifying how the model will be run.\nThe model can then be tested and validated by running simulations and comparing the results to empirical data or theoretical predictions. This process often involves iterating on the model design to refine the agents’ behaviors and improve the accuracy of the simulations.\n\n\n\nCreating behavioral models presents several challenges, including the complexity of accurately representing individual behaviors and interactions. One of the main difficulties is capturing the diversity of behaviors and preferences among agents, which can lead to emergent patterns that are not easily predictable.\nAnother challenge is ensuring that the model is computationally efficient, as complex models can require significant computational resources to run. This can limit the scale and scope of the simulations, making it difficult to explore certain aspects of the system being studied.\nAdditionally, validating the model against empirical data can be challenging, as it requires access to high-quality data and a clear understanding of the underlying processes being modeled. This can be particularly difficult in social systems, where data may be sparse or difficult to obtain.\nFinally, interpreting the results of the simulations can be complex, as emergent patterns may not have straightforward explanations. Researchers must carefully analyze the results and consider the implications for understanding the system being studied."

We use a normal distribution with tanh transformation to ensure realistic political distributions while keeping values bounded.\nThreshold Tolerance: This represents how much political difference an individual can tolerate in their interactions, ranging from 0 to 1. Higher values mean greater tolerance for political diversity.\nActivity Level: This determines the probability that someone will attend church services, ranging from 0 to 1. This starts high but can decrease based on negative experiences.\nEmotional State: This captures their current well-being level, also ranging from -1 to +1. This is the key outcome variable that determines whether someone stays or leaves.\n\nThe church environment is modeled as a realistic 400-seat sanctuary with 25 rows of pews. Each row has 16 seats arranged as 8 seats, then a center aisle, then 8 more seats. This spatial arrangement matters because people tend to interact more with those sitting nearby.\nChurch members are connected through a social network that represents friendships and regular social interactions. These connections are initially formed based on spatial proximity, political homophily, and regular attendance patterns.

Attending members interact with others, following realistic patterns where they prioritize existing strong connections, then nearby neighbors, then random others. The quality of each interaction depends on political similarity and mutual tolerance, with these interactions affecting emotional states through our core mathematical model.\nThe heart of our model is the equation for updating emotional states:\nEmotional State = Base + α × (Connection Score) - β × (Dissimilarity Penalty)\nThe base represents a person’s natural emotional baseline when attending church. Alpha (α) weights how much positive interactions with connected friends boost emotional state, while beta (β) weights how much negative interactions with politically different people hurt emotional state.\nThe social network evolves dynamically based on interactions. Connections can strengthen through positive shared experiences, new connections can form between people with high political similarity and positive interactions, and connections can weaken through poor interactions or missed attendance.

My name is Eric Araújo, and I currently hold the following positions:\n\nAssociate Professor in the Computer Science Department at Calvin University\nHead of the Behavioural Informatics Laboratory (BILbo)\n\n\nScholarship\nI investigate the spread of opinions, sentiments, and behaviors in complex systems through multiagent modeling and simulations, offering insights into social dynamics in politics, cooperation, health, criminology, and religion.\nMy work is multidisciplinary; I use computer science tools to solve problems in areas such as public security, the spread of fake news, and promoting healthier lifestyles.\nYou can download my PhD thesis from the following link:\n\nContagious: Modeling the spread of behaviours, perceptions and emotions in social networks.\n\nMy CV in English is available in this link and my ORCID.\n\n\nEducation\n\nPh.D. in Computer Science, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, The Netherlands, 2018\nM.Sc. in Computer Science, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Brazil, 2009\nB.Sc. in Computer Science, Federal University of Viçosa, Brazil, 2007\n\nYou can find more about me on my LinkTree.\n\n\nRecent Updates:\n\nI presented a work titled Behavioral Insights into Political Polarization in Christian Communities through Computational Modeling at ASA 2025 on July 19, 2025. To see my presentation, click here.\nA new paper entitled Exploring the Link Between Urban Topology and Street Crime Using Complex Networks: A Case Study from Southeast Brazil was accepted by the Journal of Complex Systems. This work was developed by the master’s student Matheus Flausino and co-supervised with Prof. Dr. Angelica de Sousa da Mata.\nA work in collaboration with Fiocruz (Brazil) will be presented as a poster during the INSNA Sunbelt 2025, to happen in Paris, France. The work is entitled Scientific Collaboration in Health and Life Sciences: A Study of Brazil’s Contributions and Partnerships.\nI participated in the event “Algorithms, Democracy and Society: challenges and perspectives” on May 28, 2025 talking about education, AI and society (in Portuguese).\nA paper entitled The use of agent-based modeling in the study of complex systems (in Portuguese only), was accepted by the Brazilian Journal of Physics Teaching. This is the result of the master’s studies of Clayton R. da Silva, in partnership with Prof. Angélica S. Mata."
