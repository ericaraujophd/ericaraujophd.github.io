I was super excited, impressed and grateful Matt and Garrett built this after I asked for it.\nThank you again.\nLaura\nLaura Ring Kapitula, PhD Associate Professor Department of Statistics\nGrand Valley State University"

Also, my social networks in English are ResearchGate and Threads. Last but not least, I have created a YouTube channel during the 2020 pandemic to divulge my work as well as teaching resources on Agent-based modeling with Netlogo.\nPlease let me know if any links are not working, or if you need some of my papers and can’t access them by emailing me.",
