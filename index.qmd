<!-- ### Computational Modeling for the Flourishing of the Whole Creation -->

Olá! My name is Eric Araújo, and currently, I hold the following positions:

- Associate Professor at the [Computer Science Department](https://calvin.edu/academics/school-stem/computer-science){target="_blank"} at [Calvin University](https://calvin.edu/){target="_blank"}
- Head of the Behavioural Informatics Laboratory (BILbo)

### Scholarship

Eric investigates the spread of opinions, sentiments, and behaviors in **complex systems** through **multiagent modeling and simulations**, offering insights into **social dynamics** in politics, cooperation, health, criminology, and religion.

Therefore, the work I develop is multidisciplinary, using computer science tools to solve problems in areas such as public security, the spread of fake news, promoting healthier lifestyles, etc.

### Recent Updates:

- A new paper was accepted by the *Journal of Complex Systems*. This work was developed by the master’s student Matheus Flausino and co-supervised with Prof. Dr. Angelica de Sousa da Mata. The paper is entitled *Exploring the Link Between Urban Topology and Street Crime Using Complex Networks: A Case Study from Southeast Brazil*. It can be accessed through [this link](https://doi.org/10.1093/comnet/cnaf016){target=_blank}.
- A work in collaboration with Fiocruz (Brazil) will be presented as a poster during the INSNA Sunbelt 2025, to happen in Paris, France. The work is entitled [Scientific Collaboration in Health and Life Sciences: A Study of Brazil's Contributions and Partnerships](https://www.conftool.pro/sunbelt2025/index.php?page=browseSessions&form_session=196#paperID891){target=_blank}.
- I participated in the event ["Algorithms, Democracy and Society: challenges and perspectives"](https://algoritmosesociedade.inf.ufg.br/#inicio){target="_blank} on May 28th and 29th talking about education, AI and society (in Portuguese).
- I presented a paper titled *Modeling Introversion in the Classroom: An Agent-Based Approach* at [Autonomous Agents for Social Good 2025](https://panosd.eu/aasg2025/call/){target=_blank} held in Detroit on May 19, 2025. The paper is the result of a Senior Project developed by B.S. students Daniel Kwon and Jaden Brookens.
- My abstract titled *Behavioral Insights into Political Polarization in Christian Communities through Computational Modeling* was accepted for an oral presentation at [ASA 2025](https://network.asa3.org/mpage/ASA2025){target=_blank}.
- A paper entitled [*The use of agent-based modeling in the study of complex systems*](https://doi.org/10.1590/1806-9126-RBEF-2024-0464){target="_blank"} (in Portuguese only) was accepted by the *Brazilian Journal of Physics Teaching*. This is the result of the master's studies of Clayton R. da Silva, in partnership with Prof. Angélica S. Mata.
