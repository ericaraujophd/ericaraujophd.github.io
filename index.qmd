<!-- ### Computational Modeling for the Flourishing of the Whole Creation -->

Olá! My name is Eric Araújo, and currently, I hold the following positions:

- Associate Professor at the [Computer Science Department](https://calvin.edu/academics/school-stem/computer-science){target="_blank"} at [Calvin University](https://calvin.edu/){target="_blank"}
- Head of the Behavioural Informatics Laboratory (BILbo)

### Scholarship

Eric investigates the spread of opinions, sentiments, and behaviors in **complex systems** through **multiagent modeling and simulations**, offering insights into **social dynamics** in politics, cooperation, health, criminology, and religion.

Therefore, the work I develop is multidisciplinary, using computer science tools to solve problems in areas such as public security, the spread of fake news, promoting healthier lifestyles, etc.

### Recent Updates:

- I presented a work titled *Behavioral Insights into Political Polarization in Christian Communities through Computational Modeling* at [ASA 2025](https://network.asa3.org/mpage/ASA2025){target=_blank} on July 19, 2025. To see my presentation, click [here](https://ericaraujo.com/presentations/2025/ASA/presentation.html){target="_blank"}.

- A new paper entitled [*Exploring the Link Between Urban Topology and Street Crime Using Complex Networks: A Case Study from Southeast Brazil*](https://doi.org/10.1093/comnet/cnaf016){target=_blank} was accepted by the *Journal of Complex Systems*. This work was developed by the master’s student Matheus Flausino and co-supervised with Prof. Dr. Angelica de Sousa da Mata.

- A work in collaboration with Fiocruz (Brazil) will be presented as a poster during the INSNA Sunbelt 2025, to happen in Paris, France. The work is entitled [Scientific Collaboration in Health and Life Sciences: A Study of Brazil's Contributions and Partnerships](https://www.conftool.pro/sunbelt2025/index.php?page=browseSessions&form_session=196#paperID891){target=_blank}.

- I participated in the event ["Algorithms, Democracy and Society: challenges and perspectives"](https://algoritmosesociedade.inf.ufg.br/#inicio){target="_blank} on May 28, 2025 talking about education, AI and society (in Portuguese).

- A paper entitled [*The use of agent-based modeling in the study of complex systems*](https://doi.org/10.1590/1806-9126-RBEF-2024-0464){target="_blank"} (in Portuguese only) was accepted by the *Brazilian Journal of Physics Teaching*. This is the result of the master's studies of Clayton R. da Silva, in partnership with Prof. Angélica S. Mata.
