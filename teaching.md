> "Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn." -- Benjamin Franklin

:::{caution} Teaching Philosophy
I believe in hands-on learning and real-world applications. My courses emphasize practical problem-solving, collaborative learning, and connecting theoretical concepts to current real life problems. I also value the deep reflection on how our worldview and faith influence our understanding of technology and its impact on society.
