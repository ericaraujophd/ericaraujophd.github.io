Here you will find my publications by year. Some of them are scientific papers, some of them are interviews or newspaper's articles. I count all of it as part of my research work, and valuable as resource for those who are interested in my developments.

This page is permanently under construction, so if you want to have my whole body of publications in one place, I recommend going to my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QlE8JOoAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1).

You can also find my CV in Portuguese at [Lattes CV](http://lattes.cnpq.br/8108200264338612){target="_blank"}. Also, my social networks in English are [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Eric_Fernandes_De_Mello_Araujo){target="_blank"} and [Threads](https://www.threads.net/@eric.araujo.phd?hl=en){target="_blank"}.

I have also created a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/EricAra%C3%BAjo){target="_blank"} during the 2020 pandemic to divulge my work as well as teaching resources on Agent-based modeling with Netlogo.

Please let me know if any links are not working, or if you need some of my papers and can't access them by [emailing me](mailto:eric.araujo@calvin.edu).
