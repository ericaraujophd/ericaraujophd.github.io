# Behavioral Insights into Political Polarization in Christian Communities through Computational Modeling

This is a multidisciplinary work that involves a handful areas for study and a great deal of application. I will start by explaining what are agent-based models through some of my previous works. I will also talk about the methods for building behavioral models and the challenges when creating them. I will present then a draft for what is required to develop a model that account for the problem of Christian communities.

## Introduction

We live in a time of increasing political polarization, where individuals and groups are often divided along ideological lines. This polarization can have significant implications for social cohesion, democratic processes, and the functioning of communities. In this context, understanding the dynamics of political polarization is crucial for fostering dialogue and promoting social harmony.

The de-churching phenomenon, characterized by the decline in church attendance and participation, has been a notable trend in recent years. This trend is particularly pronounced among younger generations, who are increasingly distancing themselves from traditional religious institutions. The reasons for this shift are complex and multifaceted, encompassing cultural, social, and personal factors.

In his recent book, *The Great De-Churching*, Jim Davis and Michael Graham explore the factors contributing to this phenomenon and its implications for society. They argue that the decline in church attendance is not merely a statistical trend but a reflection of deeper societal changes, including shifts in values, beliefs, and community engagement.

Bryan Chapell, in his book *The Multigenerational Church Crisis: Why We Don't Understand Each Other and How to Unite in Mission* (2024), delves into the challenges faced by churches in bridging generational divides. He emphasizes the importance of understanding the perspectives and experiences of different age groups to foster unity and collaboration within congregations. He also points out that the de-churching process is not exclusive to younger generations, but also affects older generations, leading to a complex interplay of beliefs and practices within the church community.

The table below summarizes the key differences between the two generations, highlighting the contrasting values and priorities that contribute to the polarization within church communities:

| Aspect                     | Younger Generation (Gen Z) | Older Generation (Baby Boomers) |
|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Values                     | Individualism, social justice, inclusivity | Tradition, authority, stability |


Even though recent research has shown that the church decline stabilized in the last years, it also shows a division and a preference for different types of churches based on demographic factors such as age, gender, and political affiliation. This division is particularly pronounced among younger generations, who are more likely to seek out churches that align with their values and beliefs.

## Agent-Based Modeling

Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a powerful computational approach that allows researchers to simulate the interactions of individual agents within a system. This method is particularly useful for studying complex social phenomena, such as political polarization, as it enables the exploration of how individual behaviors and interactions can lead to emergent patterns at the group level.

In other words, ABMs are computational models that simulate behavior of individual agents. ABMs are useful for studying emergent phenomena, where the behavior of the whole system is not simply the sum of the behaviors of its parts. They are particularly useful for studying complex systems, such as social networks, where individual behaviors can lead to unexpected outcomes.

One of the main benefits of ABMs is their ability to capture the heterogeneity of individual agents and their interactions. This allows researchers to explore how different behaviors and interactions can lead to different outcomes, such as the emergence of political polarization.

This method was originally developed in the 1970s and 1980s with models for social segregation, such as Schelling's model of residential segregation. Since then, ABMs have been applied to a wide range of fields, including economics, ecology, and sociology.

ABMs receive different names in different fields, such as multi-agent systems, agent-based simulations, and agent-based computational economics. However, they all share the same basic principles of simulating the interactions of individual agents within a system.

## Methods for Building Behavioral Models

Building behavioral models involves several key steps, including defining the agents, their behaviors, and the environment in which they interact. The process typically begins with identifying the key components of the system being studied and determining how these components interact with one another.

Once the agents and their behaviors have been defined, the next step is to implement the model using a programming language or simulation platform. This involves coding the rules that govern the agents' interactions and specifying how the model will be run.

The model can then be tested and validated by running simulations and comparing the results to empirical data or theoretical predictions. This process often involves iterating on the model design to refine the agents' behaviors and improve the accuracy of the simulations.

## Challenges in Creating Behavioral Models

Creating behavioral models presents several challenges, including the complexity of accurately representing individual behaviors and interactions. One of the main difficulties is capturing the diversity of behaviors and preferences among agents, which can lead to emergent patterns that are not easily predictable.

Another challenge is ensuring that the model is computationally efficient, as complex models can require significant computational resources to run. This can limit the scale and scope of the simulations, making it difficult to explore certain aspects of the system being studied.

Additionally, validating the model against empirical data can be challenging, as it requires access to high-quality data and a clear understanding of the underlying processes being modeled. This can be particularly difficult in social systems, where data may be sparse or difficult to obtain.

Finally, interpreting the results of the simulations can be complex, as emergent patterns may not have straightforward explanations. Researchers must carefully analyze the results and consider the implications for understanding the system being studied.
