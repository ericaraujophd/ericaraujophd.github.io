## 🔬 Research & Scholarship

I investigate the spread of opinions, sentiments, and behaviors in **complex systems** through **multiagent modeling and simulations**, offering insights into **social dynamics** across diverse domains including politics, cooperation, health, criminology, and religion.

:::{tip} Multidisciplinary Approach
:class: dropdown

My work bridges computer science with multiple domains, using computational tools to address real-world challenges:

**🏛️ Political Science**: Modeling opinion dynamics and polarization in communities  
**🏥 Public Health**: Understanding behavior spread and intervention strategies  
**🛡️ Public Security**: Analyzing crime patterns through network topology  
**📱 Social Computing**: Investigating misinformation spread and social influence  
**🌱 Behavioral Change**: Promoting healthier lifestyles through computational insights

**Core Methodologies:**

- Agent-based modeling and simulation
- Complex network analysis
- Social dynamics modeling
- Cognitive behavioral frameworks
- Machine learning applications
