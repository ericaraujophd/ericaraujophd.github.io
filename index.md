    <p>Olá! My name is Eric Araújo and I am currently an Associate Professor in the <a href="https://calvin.edu/academics/school-stem/computer-science">Computer Science Department</a> at <a href="https://calvin.edu/">Calvin University</a></p>
    <p>My research explores computational approaches to understanding human behavior and social dynamics. The main principle of my studies are the intention to contribute meaningfully to the common good through rigorous scholarship and ethical frameworks. I investigate the spread of opinions, sentiments, and behaviors in <b>complex systems</b> through <b>multiagent modeling and simulations</b>, offering insights into <b>social dynamics</b> across diverse domains including politics, cooperation, health, criminology, and religion.</p>
  </div>
</div>
  <p>At Calvin University, I teach courses in computer science, data science, and agent-based modeling, always emphasizing the integration of faith and learning. I am passionate about mentoring students in research that combines technical excellence with Christian values, preparing them for careers that serve both God and society.</p>

### Multidisciplinary Approach

My work bridges computer science with multiple domains, using computational tools to address real-world challenges:

**🙏 Community, Faith & Computational Modeling**: Understanding the main dynamics of faith communities through the use of computational models  
**🏛️ Political Science**: Modeling opinion dynamics and polarization in communities  
**🏥 Public Health**: Understanding behavior spread and intervention strategies  
**🛡️ Public Security**: Analyzing crime patterns through network topology  
**📱 Social Computing**: Investigating misinformation spread and social influence  
**🌱 Behavioral Change**: Promoting healthier lifestyles through computational insights

**Core Methodologies:**

- Agent-based modeling and simulation
- Complex network analysis
- Social dynamics modeling
- Cognitive behavioral frameworks
- Machine learning applications
