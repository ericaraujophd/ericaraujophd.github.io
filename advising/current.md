## üéì B.S. Students - Faith & Learning Integration

:::{note} Modeling Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections: An Agent-Based Approach
:class: dropdown

**Students:**

- **Esther Asuquo** - Calvin University, USA (Started: Spring 2025)
- **David Barry** - Calvin University, USA (Started: Spring 2025)

**Project Description:**

This project focuses on developing agent-based models to simulate and understand the dynamics of gram-negative bacterial infections, approaching this work as Christian stewards called to use our gifts in service of healing and human flourishing. Students are exploring how computational approaches can provide insights into infection patterns and potential intervention strategies, particularly with attention to health equity and serving vulnerable populations.

**Reformed Faith Integration:**

- **Creation Care**: Understanding biological systems as part of God's intricate creation
- **Healing Ministry**: Contributing to medical knowledge that can reduce human suffering
- **Stewardship**: Using computational gifts responsibly to serve public health
- **Global Justice**: Focusing on infections that disproportionately affect the global poor

**Research Skills Developed:**

- Agent-based modeling techniques with ethical considerations
- Biological system simulation grounded in respect for creation's complexity
- Data analysis and visualization with attention to responsible representation
- Scientific writing that integrates technical excellence with Christian perspective

**Expected Outcomes:**

- Conference presentation connecting technical work to Christian calling
- Potential publication demonstrating faith-science integration
- Development of modeling framework that considers ethical implications
