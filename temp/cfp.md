# AI & Faith Conference - STEM Track

The **AI & STEM** track welcomes presentations that showcase technical work at the intersection of artificial intelligence, emerging technologies, and Christianity. We seek contributions from computer scientists, engineers, data scientists, researchers, and other scientists who are building, analyzing, or deploying AI systems and infrastructure—with awareness of the ethical, societal, and spiritual questions they raise.

We encourage submissions that include real-world systems, prototypes, algorithms, deployments, or performance evaluations—particularly those that:

* Use of AI in STEM fields
* Christian values in AI development, such as human formation, dignity, and flourishing
* Address bias, fairness, or transparency in AI models
* Implement value-aligned system architectures or explainable AI
* Explore human-AI collaboration, interaction, or oversight
* Measure or mitigate ecological or computational costs of AI
* Use AI for social good and to serve underserved communities
* Develop tools to support ethical decision-making in technical teams

We also welcome technical demonstrations, case studies, or behind-the-scenes insights into how teams are grappling with difficult design trade-offs in real systems. If your work is shaped by ethical inquiry, human-centered values, or faith-informed motivations, we want to hear from you.

You may be the first author of only one submission to the AI & STEM track. If you are involved in multiple projects, please coordinate with your co-authors to ensure each submission has a unique first author.

Papers length is limited to 4000 characters (including spaces) not counting references. Submit papers for consideration through the [following link](https://forms.office.com/r/LFtHSYhDZS).
